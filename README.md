Hi! I'm Eno Dynowski, an undergraduate cybersecurity student and research assistant at Loyola Chicago. I love to do CTF's, blue team challenges, and malware analysis. ❤️

**What I've been up to:**

- 🕵️‍♂️ Digital Forensics Challenges on [HTB](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/challenges/Forensics) and [Cyberdefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/)
- 🔠 A [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) solver written in Python
- 🚩 Capture the Flag competitions every weekend
- 🧐 Research regarding website fingerprinting

**What I've been learning about:**
- 💿 MFT and MBR parsing, FAT and NTFS filesystem structure
- 🔒 Security frameworks, Policies/Procedures/Practices
- 🐉 Ghidra ... slowly but surely
